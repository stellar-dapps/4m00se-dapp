My name is [Fyodor](https://fyodor.io), and I am a founder of **4m00se** project — the open-source embeddable form builder application with "progressive decentralization" approach.

I wanted to say a couple of words about the **4m00se** as a starter for this ongoing development blog. It would be fair to dedicate some time to describe the general idea, as it became a passion project of mine.

This **4m00se** project was started as a [submission](https://dev.to/fyodorio/create-embeddable-forms-widgets-for-decentralized-internet-1dni) to the Build with Stellar challenge on dev.to which happened on August 2024 (full disclosure: I didn't win anything). While working on the idea and the proof of concept for the application though, I recognized that there's something more that can be done around the web3-enabled form builder implementation.

I had gathered a kind of huge [backlog](/docs/dev/roadmap.html) for the application and everything around that. It is a good chance for me to fully check the assumption that web3 and blockchain can (and should!) be used for something bigger than pure decentralized finance solutions.

This idea _already_ works for me on the current stage of the development, and I had learnt a lot on the way — how Stellar works (along with Soroban and smart contracts in general), how SvelteKit works, what would be the best way to build an embeddable widget solution and what are the possible implications — and lots more. Now I'm going to get into deeper details here in this blog as it definitely might be useful for others.

And of course, I will proceed building **4m00se** and making it shine, teamed with my partner — the best UI/UX designer in the world — [Maria](https://uxapologist.com/).

If you want to get to know more about the project, check out [the documentation](https://4m00se/docs), [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/stellar-dapps/4m00se-dapp), and don't hesitate to let me know what do you think about it.
