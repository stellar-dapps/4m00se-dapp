# Using the repository as a project starter

The **4m00se** repository can be freely used (with a proper arbitrary attribution) as a starter frontend app for a Soroban project. It includes the simple set of extensive UI capabilities (including the docs and a blog page) along with all the necessary Soroban smart contract development adjustments for Rust environments.

The project deployment flow is targeted for Render's Rust environment and well tested there. Smooth work with other environments is not guaranteed.
