# 4m00se philosophy and the story behind the dapp

The name "4m00se" (`[fôrmo͞os]`) comes from a leetspeak'ed word "form", and the author's love to moose as animals — their strength, wisdom, and kindness.

Domain name `4m.lol` was selected following the same leetspeak logic, just with no moose mentioning (for brevity). Also `lol` resembles `101` which sounds like a good metaphor for an app aspiring to provide full-blown solution for forms. Interestingly, this domain name was on sale at Porkbun for $1.50.
