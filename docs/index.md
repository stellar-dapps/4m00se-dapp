# What is 4m00se?

**4m00se** is a web3-enabled form builder application. It follows the concept of "progressive decentralization", meaning that you can use the blockchain capabilities for your resulting form widgets, or can just go the simplified default route.

By default **4m00se** allows you to build simple configurable form widgets and use them on your websites with your own form submission processing callbacks.

But if you wish to, you can go the web3 route and use decentralized form config storage, and decentralized form submission gathering, which currently engages Stellar network capabilities for signing transactions, and IPFS for storing JSON form config data.
