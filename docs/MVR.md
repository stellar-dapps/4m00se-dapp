# MVR (the Most Valuable ecosystem Resources) for developing on Stellar (and their why's)

1. https://github.com/stellar/awesome-stellar — traditional collection of awesomeness dedicated to Stellar and Soroban resources (_the treasure trove which is not mentioned too often but should be_)
1. https://dev.to/stellar/build-better-with-stellar-smart-contract-challenge-a-companion-guide-2ing — the companion guide for dev.to challenge (_contains good web3 context and interesting resources to get familiar with Stellar in lots of different ways_)
1. https://developers.stellar.org/docs/learn/encyclopedia — Stellar Encyclopedia (_the main reading for those who "meh"s on AI slop_)
1. https://stellar.org/stellar-developer-hub — developer hub (_which is not very visible actually but is actually the invaluable resource of the Stellar insights_)
1. https://stellar.github.io/js-stellar-sdk/ — Stellar SDK for JavaScript (_useful as a main source of platform documentation for those who builds dapps with TS/JS_)
1. https://developers.stellar.org/docs/data/horizon — HTTP API for accessing Stellar (_a good addition to aforementioned Stellar SDK docs if you need to get into deeper mechanics, or access additional Stellar's web interface capabilities_)
1. https://developers.stellar.org/docs/build/smart-contracts/example-contracts — Soroban contract examples (_useful as a basis for contract ideas and experiments_)
1. https://stellarlight.xyz/ — ecosystem tooling map (_useful to find some inspiration for projects and get a grasp on what other folks in the community are up to_)
1. https://laboratory.stellar.org — laboratory for interactive experiments with Stellar network (_useful for testing transaction building, and validating transactions compiled via SDK_)
1. https://stellar.expert — Stellar ledger explorer (_useful for checking transaction results_)
1. https://www.ide.digicus.dev/ — cool project to simplify building Soroban contracts (_useful for Rust dummies like me_)
1. https://github.com/CoinFabrik/scout-soroban — a kind of smart contract linter (_useful to explore stuff you didn't even guess you could fuck up_)
1. https://dev.to/yuzurush/series/22205 — awesome and simple series of Soroban 101's (_give a good grasp on what you can do and which direction to look at_)
1. https://developers.stellar.org/docs/build/smart-contracts/getting-started and https://developers.stellar.org/docs/build/apps/dapp-frontend — the best and the most simple and approachable hands-on introduction to building Soroban-based dapps (_I derived my solutions mostly from these tutorials as other resource, even being more thorough are relevant sometime, are usually too specific and overcomplicated_)
1. https://github.com/stellar/soroban-example-dapp — quite sophisticated, especially in the configuration part, but actually cool example of e2e decentralized application (_based on Next, meaning will be useful for similar frameworks, like Nuxt, SvelteKit, SolidStart, Analog, or whatnot_)
1. https://quest.stellar.org/ and https://fastcheapandoutofcontrol.com/tutorial — learning Stellar and Soroban through quests (_I'm not a fan of such gamification of complex ideas, to be honest, but in this case — just try to start, it's really cool hands-on experience, allowing to look at the tooling and the possibilities from different angles_)
